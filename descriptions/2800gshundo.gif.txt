Tas tie of 2800m gemskip 100%. Achieved by me on 9/14/2024.|

This is the other potentially hardest IL in the game. Like 2600m gemskip 100%, it is extremely long with essentially no room for error. Good luck.|
|
The beginning is the same as in the gemskip any% IL (though note the RNG seed I used means there is no visible smoke from the 1f wallslide at the start).|
Don't jump from the clip, and delay an updash by one frame, and drift to the right to grab the key.|
Drift back to the right to land on the crumble, and then jump updash and drift precisely to cornerjump off the wall, and updash from the berry (with good rng).|

Rather than 2600 being a mess of frame perfects constantly, the main difficulty in this level is that the ending requires extremely precise control over maddy|
along with a couple strict frame perfects, after the extremely difficult beginning.
