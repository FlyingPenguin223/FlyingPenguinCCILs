Tas tie of 3000m 100%. Achieved by me on 2/13/2022.|

Start the level with the same downright gracejump as in any%, but here you want the late upright dash.|
Do another upright just before the balloon to keep both dashes, and buffer a walljump to grab the key.|
Then, drift left, leftdash, and updash as tightly as possible to get around the block, and drift into the berry to grab it and updash to exit.
