Tas tie of 2100m any%. This gif achieved by me 7/10/2020, first achieved by me earlier, but not sure when. Probably sometime in 2019.|

This gif shows a very difficult version of the 33f tas tie. The easy version is simply to jump and upright dash to the spring. The hard version is as follows:|
|
Hold right to walk off the starting block and gracejump on the first frame you visibly fall.|
Hold left to go around the spike block and updash to clip onto it, and jump updash to exit.|
This is quite precise but way cooler looking than the jump upright.|

There exists an even harder version of this which involves a 1f release on the starting block and an earlier gracejump, and I have done it rta, but it is not on speedrun.com.
