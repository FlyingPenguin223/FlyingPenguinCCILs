Start this level holding right, then jump and downdash against the starting platform.|
walljump when you're right in the middle of the lower tile approximately to clip the crumbles.|
Jump on the first frame you gain height from the boost and updash to clip the upper spikes.|
Hold left to clip them, and buffer two walljumps and updash to exit.|

Somewhat simple IL, though saving one frame off of a 2.300 can take a while and just requires clean movement.
