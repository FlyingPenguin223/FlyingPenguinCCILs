Start the level holding neutral and buffering jump. Wait a single frame before holding right and then upright to the first wall.|
Do two walljumps to get a somewhat unstable clip and walk off, aligning yourself at 2px away from the left wall.|
Walljump just after collecting the key and immediately upright 2 frames after the walljump to get a clip.|
Jump as early as possible and do the ending pretty much as it appears.
