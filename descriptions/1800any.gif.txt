This IL is rather infamous for feeling extremely random. You will likely be 1f off many times before getting it. It's part of the experience :)|

Start the level with a buffered downright dash, and buffer the gracejump from it while holding right.|
release right and then do an upright dash just before falling into the spikes.|
Then, do a first frame upleft dash as you clip the spikes, and buffer a gracejump from it.|
Upleft to the final balloon and updash first frame from it.
