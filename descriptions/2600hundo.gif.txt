Tas tie of 2600m 100%. Achieved by me on 3/22/2024.|

Start the level holding right and downright dash on the next frame.|
Delay a gracejump as much as possible and hold right for a while before rightdashing to grab the key and immediately upleft dashing to cleanly land on the block.|
Leftdash from the block first frame and do similar but slightly different movement as the any% tas to clip the spike, and the same downright and upright to get to the end.|
downright first frame on the block to grab the berry and updash twice to exit.
