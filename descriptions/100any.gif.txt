Tas tie of 100m any%. First achieved by me on 1/13/2021.|

First, jump and downdiag onto the first block, then delay the next jump until after the buffer window.|
dash twice across that block and buffer the gracejump from the 2nd dash, and buffer the walljump.|
diag on the first frame you can land on the block (which is much later than it appears at first)|
while sliding up on the block, release right for 1 or 3 frames to manipulate x subpixels to land 1f faster.|
then, jump and updash exit.|
