Tas tie of 100m any%. First achieved by me on 1/13/2021.

First, jump and downdiag onto the first block, then delay the next jump until after the buffer window.
dash twice across that block and buffer the gracejump from the 2nd dash, and buffer the walljump.
then, hold left until the first frame you can diag and land on the block.
while sliding up on the block, release right for 1 or 3 frames to manipulate x subpixels to land 1f faster.
then, jump and updash exit.
