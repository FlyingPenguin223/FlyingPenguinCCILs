i HATE this strat with a burning passion. I have no idea how people (meep, feetballer) do this in runs.|

Start this level by buffering a rightdash, then gracejump and rightdash to the spring.|
hold left and updash to grab the balloon (requires good rng), then upleft dash and pray that you cjump and then walljump to exit.|
This strat is extremely inconsistent for me and just requires grinding it out.
