Start the level with a jump and press left to align yourself with the border.|
Do two spikejumps against the upper spike block, and then drift right before updashing twice to the berry.|
From there, the rest of the level plays out about as it looks, with precise dash timings to clip on the end, and then the same ending as in any%.
