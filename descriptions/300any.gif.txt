Tas tie of 300m any%. Achieved by me on 02/20/2021.|

The third level in a row with a stupid tas strat to save only 1f over the rta strat :/|
|
Start this level by buffering left for one frame, then downright dashing and upright dashing to clip the spike.|
buffer a jump off the clip and upright to land perfectly on the platform, then jump left and updash walljump and cjump to exit.
