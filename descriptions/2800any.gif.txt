Tas tie of 2800m any%. Achieved by me on 2/9/2022.|
|
Start the level by holding right and delaying a downright dash by a couple frames (I like to jump at the start but it doesn't actually do anything).|
Walljump as early as possible and drift all the way left.|
Once you've fallen into the lower chamber thingy, do a rightdash and downright to the crumbles.|
Hold neutral after the downright to bonk the right block without wallsliding, and immediately after falling past the block, hold right to landing clip the crumbles.|
Gracejump low from the crumble block and rightdash, then upright and cornerjump twice.|
Updash and hold left to clip the spikes, then jump and updash twice to exit.
