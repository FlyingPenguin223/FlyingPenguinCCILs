Tas tie of 2300m gemskip. Achieved by me on 8/17/2023.|

As appears to be the pattern with 2300m, there aren't too many subtleties to break down here. Everything is precise but about how it looks.|
Getting the ending movement perfect will take some time but there isn't really a trick to it, just practice and feeling.|
All I can really say is make sure the gracejump from the boost is done right.
