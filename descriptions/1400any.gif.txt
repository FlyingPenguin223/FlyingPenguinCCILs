Tas tie of 1400m any%. Achieved by me on 7/30/2020.|

Annoying but doable IL, start with a buffered downright dash and delay the gracejump as much as possible and rightdash on the spring.|
Buffer a gracejump from the spring and upright frame perfectly to land on the platform with good yrem.|
Jump and updash extremely late to clip the block, jump from there and walljump 1f before doing the upleft so you can get a cornerjump at the end.
