Tas tie of 800m any%. Achieved by me on 12/25/2022.|

an annoyingly difficult but not absurd IL.|
Start the level holding left, and hit the border to change parity and immediately start holding right.|
Here, the specific timings can vary, so I'll describe my method of doing this IL.|
|
Updash when your x position aligns with the left side of the lower block on the overhang (the block you're about to walljump off).|
tap right for two frames after the updash, then press left the frame before you walljump.|
If you've done the inputs properly, you should be able to cornerjump very late off the next block,|
and barely grab the balloon with good rng. Then, hold left for two full frames (!!)before grabbing the balloon.|
Upleft dash first frame off the balloon and buffer two walljumps to exit.|
