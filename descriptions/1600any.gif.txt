Tas tie of 1600m any%. Achieved by me on 8/14/2020.|

This IL holds a special place in my heart, as I discovered the boost at the start of the level and all the further optimizations :)|
|
Start the level with a buffered jump while holding right, and downright to landing clip the starting platform and go into the mysterious hole in the ground.|
Buffer a gracejump (yep, it's not a walljump (though it doesn't make a difference here since walljumps and normal jumps have identical y trajectories)) and clip the spike by holding right.|
Gracejump early from the boost, and tap left to align yourself precisely with the left edge of the wall (not with the spikes).|
tap left just before you would die to the spikes and walljump so that the walljump is performed flush with the wall, rather than 2px away as in a normal spikejump.|
updash and hold right to clip the final spikes on the top, and jump updash to exit.|
if you get this, congrats on sub-2 club!
