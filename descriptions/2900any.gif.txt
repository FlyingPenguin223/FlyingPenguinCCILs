Start the level holding right, and then delay a downrightdash by a single frame.|
Buffer a gracejump and an nsfw cjump, and then precisely time two upright dashes to clip on the last spike block.|
Do a first frame upright dash on the last spike block, and then updash to exit.|

The two uprights are very difficult to time properly, finding a good cue is very important.
