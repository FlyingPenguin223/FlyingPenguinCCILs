Tas tie of 200m any%. Achieved by me on 11/02/2020.|

This level is very wacky. To tas tie, start with a downright dash and buffer a jump|
then cornerjump on the wall on the last possible frame. Buffer two walljumps, then updash where I do in the gif.|
start holding right to clip the spike 1f after you would be able to buffer right|
and continue to hold right to downdiag off the spike platform.|
buffer a gracejump, the cornerjump, and the walljumps to exit.
