extremely annoying and consistent IL.|
There are a couple ways to get the first clip, as the main difficulty is that holding right and diagonal dashing won't clip due to bad xrem.|
My personal favourite is to start the level buffering right, then release when maddy's front foot aligns with the stalk of the grass on the left.|
wait a couple frames, then upright dash without pressing right on the previous frame to spikeclip.|
buffer a jump and updash somewhat late while still being able to buffer left and hit your head on the block to land on the ending platform|
then jump updash to exit.|
|
Other methods for getting the first clip include: |
 - start the level holding neutral and jump, then on the next frame start holding right and keep holding to diag and clip.|
 - start the level holding neutral and wait a bit longer before holding right and doing the same as the above method from there.|
 - start the level holding right and briefly release right at some point which you'll have to mess with yourself, and then diag to clip
