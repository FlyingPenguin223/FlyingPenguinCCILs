Start the level holding left and jump. There are many timings for the beginning, but I will describe the one performed in this gif, which I consider the easiest.|
Downdash after 2 frames to break the berry block and slightly delay the gracejump from it, before updashing to get a slightly dirty clip on the spikes.|
Gracejump late from the clip and diag walljump to exit.|
|
Other timings for the start involve downdashing a frame earlier, and/or using a diagonal dash to clip.|
