Tas tie of 2500m any%. Achieved by me on 8/10/2020.|

Start the level with three frame perfect rightdashes to the spring.|
Hold left after hitting the spring to bonk against the left block, and do two upleft dashes to the spring.|
The diag timings here are very strange to get used to, and will take a lot of trial and error to get the hang of. The second one in particular is extremely early.|
Then, simply updash twice to exit with a down facing spikeclip.
