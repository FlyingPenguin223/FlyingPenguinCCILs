All the movement to the top area is identical to any%, including the final walljump, but make sure you do a leftdash instead of an upleft.|
On the top area, do 3 leftdashes, and then jump and downleft to grab the berry, and gracejump from the downleft to exit.|
Make sure not to dash to exit, as that will only lose you the number of frames in the dash startup animation.
