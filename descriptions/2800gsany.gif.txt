Tas tie of 2800m gemskip. Achieved by me on 4/5/2024.|

This is arguably the most difficult gemskip IL, along with 2600m.
|
Start the level with the same delayed downright dash as in the any% tas, and the same walljump.|
However, while holding right, tap left for one frame to wallslide on the middle block, and then release right.|
Once past the middle block, hold right for 4 frames before immediately releasing right and doing an empty dash on the same frame.|
Do a first frame dash off the crumble, buffer a gracejump, and do a very early upright dash.|
Here, the first cornerjump must be delayed by one frame, which forces the next cornerjump to require a perfect 15hz mash.|
After that, updash and clip the spikes.|
The horizontal movement for the ending is very very precise, and will require some tinkering in the tas tool to understand and find a timing that works.|
For this reason, I recommend studying the file for this part.
