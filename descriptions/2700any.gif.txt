Tas tie of 2700m any%. Achieved by me on 8/10/2020.|

Start the level with a buffered downright dash, and gracejump on the last frame. While drifting to the right, release right for one frame as to not die to the spikes.|
Upleft dash as early as possible under the wall and cornerjump on the other side.|
|
There are a couple different ways to do the ending, the one done in this gif involves an updash to the balloon, and a brief right tap before the walljump and updashes.|
Then, hold left and nsfw cjump to exit.
