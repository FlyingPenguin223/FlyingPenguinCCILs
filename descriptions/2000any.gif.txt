Tas tie of 2000m any%. Achieved by me on 6/8/2021.|

Wait for the crumble to break, and then do a frame perfect downright dash such that you can gracejump afterwards and keep your dash.|
I like to time the downright with two jumps at the start of the level, however any method of timing it you like can work (as long as you don't dash).|
Perform the next dashes frame perfectly with the gif. There isn't much to say about this, but every dash here needs to be at the exact space as it is done in the tas and here.|
if all of that is done correctly, after the cornerjump to the balloon and upleft dash, you should clip on the ice. Leftdash immediately and do the exit as it appears.|

Getting all those dashes perfect is very difficult and often quite frustrating. Good luck.
