Tas tie of 2500m gemskip 100%. Achieved by me on 9/21/2024.|

This might be the easiest gemskip 100% IL, but it's still quite difficult.|
|
Start the level with a leftdash gracejump updash to grab the key and clip the spikes. This is pretty much identical to the basic 500m clip strat, but to the left.|
Don't jump from the clip, just walk to the right and downright as early as possible to grab the berry.|
Hold right the entire time, and buffer a walljump off the little nub and rightdash to the spring block.|
From there, movement is essentially identical to the gemskip any% route, which I described in more detail in that description.
