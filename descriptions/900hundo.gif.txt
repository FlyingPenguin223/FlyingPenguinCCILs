Tas tie of 900m 100%. Achieved by me on 06/11/2021.|

Rather simple tas tie, start with the same thing as the any% strat, but then updash to break the berry block and collect the berry.|
Make sure you don't wallslide when you hold left and upleft dash as early as possible but somewhat away from the block on the x axis.|
cornerjump and walljump to exit.
