Tas tie of 700m 100%. Achieved by me on 9/18/2024.|

I'm not going to even attempt to explain the inputs in this tas. They're so awful, just find the tas file and fidget with the start|
until you find something that feels decent. This IL will probably take either a ton of grinding or a lot of luck (I could also just be bad).|

Note that if you find yourself constantly getting 78s or some other similar time, you're probably doing the start wrong.
